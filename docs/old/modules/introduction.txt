Modules contain all resources, that are necessary for a PHP application. The \
idea is, that you have one place, that not only holds class files but \
everything from class to image.

To create a module use the web front end or the command line:

<geshi type="bash">
php r/cli/foomo.php createModule moduleName "['moduleFoo', 'moduleBar']" "an awesome module doing really great stuff"
</geshi>
