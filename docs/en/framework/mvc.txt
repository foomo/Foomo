Well there is an MVC implementation in this framework as well, actually you \
are looking at a foomo MVC application right now. It is a spin-off product of \
the toolbox. It is not trying to compete with "real" server rountrip MVC \
frameworks like symfony or zend. We think, that the future does not belong to \
those frameworks.

This is one of the reasons, why we have written foomo. The future is \
client / server style apps with an extremely simple and crawlable fallback. \
Foomo\MVC is designed to build exactly those extremely simple fallbacks.

If what you are trying to build with it starts feeling wrong, then it is most \
likely, because you are trying to build something too complex.

++++ Controller

Conventions

* all public methods starting with action are exposed
* action<name> matches to the view <name>, if <name> does not exist it falls back to the default
* exceptions are caught and mapped to an exception view named like the exception namespace separators are replaced with dots

<geshi type="php" file="<?= __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'examples' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'My.Module.Frontend.Controller.php' ?>">
</geshi>

++++ Views

Conventions

* $view and $model are mapped into views no matter, if exception, partial or regular view

<geshi type="php" file="<?= __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'examples' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'view.tpl' ?>">
</geshi>

++++ Partials

<geshi type="php" file="<?= __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'examples' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'partial.tpl' ?>">
